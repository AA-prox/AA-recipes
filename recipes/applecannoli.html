    <h3>Apple Cannoli</h3>
    <p>
        Pipe a sweet-tart apple filling and creamy ricotta into crunchy cannoli shells for a crowd-pleasing dessert.
        If you prefer, you can use a small offset spatula to remove the cannoli shells from the hot oil: 
        Insert the end of the spatula into the opening of the mold and lift to remove from oil.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flur, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, plus more as needed.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Apple Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 large Granny Smith apples, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple pie spice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ricotta Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) tub whole milk ricotta cheese, drained</li>
        <li>1/4 cup confectioner's sugar, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Shells</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg white, lgihtly beaten</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For dough, stir together flour, white sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Make a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Add egg, Marsala, water, and vinegar to well. Mix with a fork until dough starts to come together. Transfer to a flour-dusted work surface; knead until dough forms a ball, about 10 minutes, adding 1 teaspoon water as needed. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight).</li>
        <li>For apple filling, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add apples, brown sugar, apple pie spice, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft, about 15 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together lemon juice and cornstarch; add to apple mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer cooled mixture to a pastry bag.</li>
        <li>For ricotta filling, stir together drained ricotta and powdered sugar in a large bowl; fold in lemon zest. Transfer mixture to a pastry bag.</li>
        <li>To shape and fry shells, divide dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 ball into a 16- to 18-inch circle, about 1/16 inch thick or less. Using a 4- to 5-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 12 circles. Dust circles with a light coating of flour. (This will help you later in removing shells from cannoli tube molds.) Roll each dough circle around a cannoli tube, sealing edges with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough ball.</li>
        <li>Pour oil to a depth of 3 inches in a deep, heavy-bottomed 4-quart pot or deep fryer; heat to 375°F. (You’ll need about 1 quart oil.) Working in batches, fry shells on tubes, turning halfway through, until golden, about 1 minute. Using tongs, transfer shells to a wire rack lined with paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Let stand just until tubes are cool enough to handle, then carefully twist each tube to remove shell. (Using a kitchen towel may help your grip.) Wash or wipe off tubes to use for remaining shells, if needed.</li>
        <li>To assemble, pipe apple filling into shells, filling two-thirds full from center to one end and repeating on other side. Repeat piping method with ricotta filling. Garnish cannoli with powdered sugar.</li>
